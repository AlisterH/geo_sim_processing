# GeoSim
Line simplification tools for python using shapely and fiona libraries

Introduction

Sherbend is a geospatial line simplification tool (another...).  It's the implementation of the algorithm from the papaer "Line Generalization Based on Analysis of Shape Characteristics, Zeshen Wand and Jean-Clsaude MÃ¼ller, 1998" often known as "Bend Simplify" or "Wang Algorithm".  The particularity of this line simplification algorithm is that it analyses for a line each of it's curves and decide which one to simplify as a cartographer would do to manually simplify a line.  Compared to Douglas-Peucker this algorithm tries to preserve the maximum number of curves or bends (line definition) with the minimum number of vertices, Sherbend algorithm tries to remove unnecessar curves based on a tolerance (curve diameter

## Requirements  
- Python 3.7 with the following libraries:
    - Shapely
    - Rtree
    - Fiona

## Installation on your workstation
Using conda, you can set and activate your python environment with the following commands: 
    ```shell
    conda create -p YOUR_PATH python=3.7 shapely rtree
    source activate YOUR_ENV
    pip install fiona
    ```
    
  Note on the installation:
  - fiona needs to be installed separatly has there is a problem (wtih conda?) when you try to installes shapely, rtree, fiona at the same time
  - for Windos users, do not forget that shapely, rtree and fiona are all python wrapper of C libraries and need DLLs so use the appropriate installer (not just pip)

##Usage

usage: sherbend.py [-h] [-eh] [-ep] [-pl] [-d DIAMETER | -dl DLAYER] in_file out_file

positional arguments:
  in_file               input vector file to simplify
  out_file              output vector file simplified

optional arguments:
     -h, --help               show this help message and exit
  
     -eh, --exclude_hole      exclude holes (interior) below minimum adjusted area
  
     -ep, --exclude_polygon   exclude polygons below minimum adjusted area
  
     -pl, --per_layer         evaluate topology per layer only (feature from
                              different layers can overlap after simplification)
                          
     -d , --diameter          diameter of the minimum adjusted area bend to simplify
                        
     -dl, --dlayer            diameter of the minimum adjusted area bend to simplify
                              per layer name (ex: -dl Road=5,Hydro=7.5)

##How it works (Rule of thumb)

##Topological relationships

#Simplicity

#Intersection

#Sidedness
